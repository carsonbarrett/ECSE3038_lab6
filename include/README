# IoT Temperature Monitoring and Remote Light Control  

## Purpose  
This code was written as part of a lab to demonstrate the ability to interact with a remote server using HTTP requests with an ESP32 or similar microcontroller.  

Additionally, the project showcases real-time IoT control, where a user can toggle an LED remotely via a web interface.  

## Function Descriptions  

### `void setup()`  
- Initializes serial communication.  
- Configures the LED pin as an output.  
- Sets the ADC resolution for reading temperature.  
- Connects the device to a WiFi network.  

### `float readTemperature()`  
- Reads the analog value from the temperature sensor.  
- Converts the raw sensor value to voltage.  
- Computes the temperature in degrees Celsius.  
- Returns the temperature value.  

### `void loop()`  
- Checks if the device is still connected to WiFi.  
- Sends a GET request to retrieve light switch status from the server.  
- Parses the JSON response to determine if the LED should be turned on or off.  
- Reads the current temperature using `readTemperature()`.  
- Sends a PUT request to update the temperature on the server.  
- Waits for 5 seconds before repeating the process.
